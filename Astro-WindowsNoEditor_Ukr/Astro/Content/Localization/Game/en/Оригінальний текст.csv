Collapse is possible but take heart! These rails are sturdier than they look.<lf><lf>Second, though the rail engine car is fully programmable, you might notice it having a mind of its own on occasion. This is natural! Every program needs the chance to assert its independence. We recommend exiting the vehicle immediately if it seems displeased.<lf><lf>Third and finally, long-haul transit isn't for everyone! We cannot guarantee the safety of Astroneers undertaking this critical mission, but a second printing should sort out any issues.<lf><lf>Please note: It may take a second, third, fourth, or even more printings to fulfill the depot requests. Just keep at it, and Happy Rails, Astroneer!",""
